# Homepage

A Homepage website that allows you to save the websites you usually visit on the web.

The website include some common websites to display when you first open it.

## About 

I build this website using React with Typescript and some components from Material UI (MUI).

I use the browser localstorage in order to make persistent the state of the application.

So whenever you shutdown your computer, close this site tab or close the web browser, your data will persist and once your enter the website again you will see all your websites.
